<strong>SPECIAL TOPICS IN NARRATIVE IMPROVISATION:</strong>
<br><br>
<b><em>March 22 - Scene Paint Your Way Into and Out Of a Paper Bag<br>
with Quinn Buckner</b></em> (Big Bash cast member and half of Austin/Austin)
Need to get out some information but it would be to awkward to do with dialogue? Need to jump start your scenes and stories? Let’s get loosy goosy with some scene painting and see all the ways we can use this fantastic device.
<br><br>
<b><em>March 29 - Commit, Dammit<br>
with Jeremy Sweetlamb</b></em> (director of 2016′s Process and Available Cupholders)
If you don’t believe in your stories, why should the audience!? We’ll talk about easy tricks and small tweaks you can make to your improv that will help sell your ideas and characters. You will also fill out a brief survey before class informing Sweetlamb of how intense you want your feedback to be.
<br><br>
<b><em>April 5 - Play More, Plot Less<br>
with Manuel Duran</b></em> (director of Theatresports and student mainstage Long Days, Hot Nights)
Narratives can be stressful but they don’t have to be! This workshop will focus on helping you bring delight and joy to your narrative work so that you can stop plotting and start playing.
<br><br>
<b><em>April 12 - Romance & Intimacy<br>
with Kaci Beeler</b></em> (director of Peter Pan and the January 2018 mainstage Orphans!)
Narrative improv is soulless without real connection, but how do we get to those intimate places on the spot in front of an audience? Join Kaci Beeler in an introduction to her signature series on romance and intimacy in improvisation. Real connection on stage IS possible and it is also very, very fun.
<br><br>
<b><em>April 19 - Slower is Faster<br>
with Andrew Buck</b></em> (director of Theatresports and Big Bash cast member)
Some of the most impressive improv seems to move both quickly and patiently at the same time. How is this even possible?!? Easy–by learning how to give and take, how to play on your tiptoes without tipping over. We’ll spend a few hours drilling a tight, focused, crisp manner of playing with our colleagues. You’ll wow the crowd.
<br><br>
<b><em>April 26 – The Power of Positivity<br>
with Jon Bolden</b></em> (director of Nothing and Everything: Improvised Chekhov)
Agreement is a powerful & important element of storytelling that is often underappreciated. Starting with positive relationships, staying on the same team, and being in agreement can build the foundation for a compelling narrative and propel you into richer scene work. This workshop explores strategic tools and approaches as well as a broader, holistic view of positive world building and character creation.
<br><br>
<b><em>May 3 - Turn Your Passion Into a Format<br>
with Margaret Hunsicker</b></em> (director of upcoming Horror: The Musical!)

<br><br>
<b><em>May 10 - Building an Ensemble<br>
with J.R. Zambrano</b></em> (director of the upcoming How I Saved the World Over Summer Vacation)
Ensembles can kick a story into overdrive. Come learn how to create a group of friends/unlikely heroes/ragtag bunch/motley crew that thrives because of its diverse perspectives and relationships that drive the story on!
<br><br>
<b><em>May 17 - Make it Meaningful<br>
with Ryan Austin</b></em> (director of Theatresports and regular mainstage performer)

<br><br>
<b><em>May 24 – Break Into Song<br>
with Kacey Samiee</b></em> (director of Improvised Rock Opera and regular mainstage performer)
Song placement within a narrative is crucial. We’ll go over two of the most important things about musical improv: What’s the song about? Where does it go?
<br><br>
<b><em>May 31 - Break All The Rules<br>
with Andy Crouch</b></em> (director of Start Trekkin’ and Hideout education director)
This workshop will look at how to successfully break all the “rules” of Narrative. Make your main character unlikable! Start in a the middle of the action and story! Stop making the smart moves and make all the fun moves.
<br><br>
<b><em>June 7 - Rocket-Fuel Objectives
with Kevin Miller</b></em> (education director at Merlin Works and assistant director of Fiasco)
