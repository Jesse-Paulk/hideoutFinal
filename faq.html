     				<h3>Do your shows have assigned seats or are they General Admission?</h3>
     				<p>

              All of our shows are General Admission. We will start seating around 10 minutes before showtime. If you have special requirements
              and would like more time to be seated, or need to sit closer for vision- or hearing- related concerns, please arrive a half hour
              before show time and let our box office person know. We will be happy to accommodate you.

     				<h3>Where Do I Park?</h3>
     				<p>
              We admit, downtown parking is difficult at times (we deal with it every day). That’s why we’ve partnered with the
              Saint David’s parking garage to offer $5 parking to all patrons. Just show your order confirmation email when entering.
              More details are here. There are also several other pay lots and garages close to the Hideout Theatre (we’re at 7th and Congress)
               and they run between $8-$15. Some parking garages close to The Hideout Theatre include the Perry Brooks Garage, Littlefield Garage,
               and the Capitol Center Parking Garage. There are pay meters that run until midnight Thursday through Saturday downtown (on which you are
                allowed a max time of 3 hours). We recommend patrons make time for parking when taking a trip to the Hideout Theatre.

     				<h3>What Are Your Age Restrictions?</h3>
     				<p>
              There is no minimum age to get into the theater. You don’t have to be 18 or 21 to attend one of our performances.
          </div>
     			<hr>
     			<div id="section5">
     				<h3>What Age are Your Shows Appropriate for?</h3>
     				<p>
              It’s improv, and different every time, so we cannot give you an exact estimate, but our shows are usually PG-13 in content.
               Our evening shows are still for adults and not meant for children. They may contain harsh language and innuendo.
               If an evening show is family-friendly, it will be stated in the description for the show on our website. If you would like a
               recommendation or further information about the possible content or themes in a show beforehand, feel free to e-mail our Artistic
               Director Roy Janik at roy@hideouttheatre.com.<br>
               <br>
              That said, anyone is welcome to bring younger patrons to our theatre, but use your own discretion.
              For ages 3-10 we have a special kids improv show every Sunday at 2pm.
              <br>
              This show is rated G.

     				<h3>How Long Are Your Shows</h3>
     				<p>
              Our shows are about an hour and a half each. No show is over 2 hours in length. The Sunday kids show is an hour long.
            </p>

     				<h3>Are You Wheelchair accessible?</h3>
     				<p>
              Some of our shows are wheelchair accessible. We have two theaters in our building, and our ground-floor theater is
              accessible while our upstairs theater is not. We are housed in a Historic building, in an intimate space. Our ground-floor
               theater, where we have our 8pm and 10pm Saturday night shows IS wheelchair accessible. The Big Bash (Fridays at 8pm) is also
                wheelchair accessible. When we have special events, like New Year’s Eve, Out of Bounds, and WaffleFest, we host several shows
                in the ground-level theater and those shows are also wheelchair accessible. All shows that are wheelchair accessible will be noted
                as such. For more information and requests for space ahead of time (highly recommended) contact Roy Janik our Artistic Director at roy@hideouttheatre.com.

     				<h3>Should I Buy Tickets Online or Wait to Buy them in Person?</h3>
     				<p>
              We recommend buying tickets online. Our upstairs theater seats 49, so some shows sell out very quickly. There is no additional charge
               for purchasing tickets online, so if you know for sure you want to come, there’s no reason to wait until the night of the show to get tickets!

     				<h3>Can I Bring Food or Drinks into the Theatre?</h3>
     				<p>
              Yes, if you bought the food and drinks from the Hideout Coffee House.

     				<h3>Do I Need to Bring a Print-Out of my Ticket Receipt?</h3>
     				<p>
              No. We only need your name at the box office to claim your ticket/s.
            </p>
     			</div>
           <hr>
     			<div id="section11">
     				<h3>I have a Free Ticket, how do I use it Online?</h3>
     				<p>
              You cannot use a free ticket online. If you absolutely want to see a show, we recommended buying tickets beforehand online,
               as we have intimate theaters and shows tend to sell-out. If a show sells out, a free ticket cannot get you into a show.
               If a show is not sold-out when you present the ticket at the box office 30 minutes before the show, your ticket will get you
               in for free (not valid on special events).

     				<h3>How much are Your Tickets?</h3>
     				<p>
              The price varies per show, but the cost for our usual shows is anywhere from $5-$15. Special event shows may cost more. Tickets purchased online do not have any additional processing or convenience fees.

     				<h3>What Happened to your $1 convenience fee?</h3>
     				<p>
              It’s gone. Poof. Zap. Adios. We were tired of paying convenience fees to venues ourselves, so we decided to lead by example and eliminate our fees, even though, at $1, they were already the lowest we’d seen.
