<p dir="ltr">Jessica Arjet offers consulting for Youth Programs, including classes, summer camps, on-going shows, and touring shows. She can help you start a new program as well as help with existing programs.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Topics Include:</em></p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Design and Create Curriculum.</strong> Developing a curriculum for specific age groups and interests. Make sure you are teaching your students what you want them to know in a way that they want to learn. Or you can buy the Hideout’s Youth curriculum along with consulting for how to implement it.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>How to Run a Youth Program.</strong> Running a youth program comes with its own exciting challenges and rewards. Learn all the tricks and techniques so that you don’t have to make the most common mistakes. This includes: hiring staff, structuring the day, advertising, dealing with parents, handling problems that commonly occur, and overall philosophies.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Creating a Summer Camp.</strong> Summer camps are fun and lucrative.(They are a great way to start up something for youth without committing to a year round program.) Similar to the youth program this includes: hiring staff, structuring the day, advertising, dealing with parents, handling problems that commonly occur, and overall philosophies.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Shows for Youth.</strong> Shows are the most effective (and self-sustaining) advertising for your classes and other programs.  Create a show that kids will love: casting, advertising, making up formats, handling heavy interaction with tiny people, keeping it fresh each week. We can also touch on touring to schools and libraries.</p>
</li>

<p dir="ltr">Kareem Badr offers consulting to help you navigate the Formation &amp; Structure of Your Business, Accounting &amp; Bookkeeping, Tech Setup for Improv, and Day-to-Day Details of Business Ownership.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Topics Include:</em></p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Structuring Your Business.</strong> When forming a business, you have a few options available to you. Should you be a non-profit with a board of directors? Will an LLC help protect you legally and financially? Maybe you will incorporate. Each option has different rules that will affect decision-making, liability, and profit-distribution (you want profits, right?)</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Accounting &amp; Bookkeeping.</strong> How much money are you spending on marketing? Are your specialty workshops profitable? What shows should you pour your marketing effort into? Learning a few simple procedures and data-tracking techniques will enable you to get insight to how your business is doing, and remove emotion and voodoo from decision-making.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Technical Setup for Improv.</strong> The tech is one of the elements of an improv show that we can control and prepare ahead of time. Learn about your different lighting and sound options, and the benefits and drawbacks of each. LEDs or incandescents? Light-board or software-controlled lights? What kind of PA and audio gear will you need? Can you take advantage of local or state energy subsidies? Figuring out your technical requirements will make finding and renovating your future improv home a lot easier.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The Nitty Gritty.</strong> A small business, particularly an improv theatre, is a mass of details, processes, and forms. The 10% of the business the public sees hides 90% of the details and decisions lurking below the surface. Liability insurance, credit card processing, sales tax, repair and maintenance expenses, and more. Become aware of everything Kareem has encountered so you don&#8217;t drown in an ocean of unexpected paperwork.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5496" style="margin: 3px; float:right; display:inline-block;" title="Kareem-Bio-Image" src="http://www.hideouttheatre.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/Kareem-Bio-Image.jpg" alt="" width="120" height="120" /><strong>

			<h4 dir="ltr"><span style="color: #800000;">Artistic Direction for Improv</span></h4>
<p dir="ltr">Roy Janik offers consulting for improv theaters that need guidance on how best to create, maintain, and manage shows/special events.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Topics Include:</em></p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Scheduling.</strong> When choosing what sort of improv shows to put on at your theater, there are an infinite number of possibilities. The choices can be overwhelming, and it’s hard to know what to schedule, especially when just starting out. Learn to consider and select from the many different show types available to you: community-building showcase, ongoing shows, limited run “theatrical” shows, and specific formats that have worked well at The Hideout.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Show and Special Event Management.</strong> Unlike in scripted theatre models, improv theaters often have shows every weekend, and some specific shows might run for years. Learn the art of keeping a show going, keeping it fresh, keeping the performers engaged in the process. Learn to organize special events and festivals to keep them running smoothly and not driving you crazy&#8230; including staffing, timetables, press releases, etc&#8230;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Bootstrapping and Community Building.</strong> Are you starting from scratch? Roy’s been all over the world and seen a lot of improv communities. Learn how to build your theatre and community from the ground up.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Inter-Theater Relationships.</strong> It’s tempting to feel jealous or at odds with other theaters or companies in your area. It can be a real challenge to stop seeing them as competitors, and start seeing them as allies. Learn how to get along, and where/when to set boundaries. Expand your support network to include the ever-growing community of improvisers and theaters, in your city and beyond.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Spreadsheets‽</strong> It’s hard to believe, but half of the job of being an artistic director is using spreadsheets. It can even be fun if you embrace it. Use spreadsheets (Google Docs) to handle submissions, casting, and scheduling.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-8118" style="margin: 3px; float:right; display:inline-block;" title="Roy-Bio-Image" src="http://www.hideouttheatre.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Roy-Bio-Image.jpg" alt="" width="120" height="120" />

  Andy Crouch</strong>
  <br>
   fell in love with improv in 2001 because it was cool, scary and seemed like it might change his life forever. More than a decade later he makes his living as the education and corporate director at the Hideout Theatre in Austin, Texas. His best friends are the people that he plays with every weekend and he’s married to a beautiful girl that he met through improv. What seemed scary and cool at first has turned out over the years to be endlessly intriguing and life-affirming. Plus he gets to laugh a lot.</p>
