            Improv helps lives – no, really, it does! Kids who take improv classes at the Hideout Theatre learn how to hone their
            listening skills, express themselves creatively, work and play with others, take risks, and communicate effectively.
             With classes expanding to serve youth on the Autism Spectrum and at-risk youth, the impact of the Hideout youth programming has continued to grow.</br>
             <br />
             Every year the Hideout strives to give the gift of improv to as many kids as possible, including those who aren’t able to afford it.
              Every dollar received in donation to the Kids Improv Scholarship will go towards helping a child take an improv class.

          <h4>To give you an idea of how vital this is, here’s a list of what the money we raised in 2013 & 2014 accomplished:</h4><br />
          1. We were able to allow 13 kids to participate in summer camps or classes who otherwise would not have been able to afford them<br /></br>
          2. We were able to discount show prices to bring Flying Theater Machine to area libraries and schools, thus exposing kids from all over Austin to improv and interactive theater.<br /></br>
          3. We were able to discount workshops at Libraries to introduce kids to the basic concepts of improv, enhancing their engagement with the arts<br /></br>
          4. We offered 6 scholarships to kids for the Special Needs classes, so that kids with special needs could attend classes that wouldn’t be able to otherwise.<br /></br>
          5. We continue to run a weekly class in a shelter to bring enrichment, social skills, and a fun break to homeless children and their parents.<br /></br>
          6. We were able to provide an improv teacher for the Andy Roderick Foundation, Side by Side Foundation, and Austin Center for Education to bring enrichment to very low income kids.<br /></br>
          7. We helped send two staff members to the Applied Improv Conference where they spoke about the Special Needs program – from that one of our staff members will now be teaching
          these concepts in a program in Indiana this summer, ensuring that even more special needs children get access to this remarkable therapeutic tool.<br /></br>
          8. We provided weekly improv classes to at-risk foster youth in a residential treatment setting at a significantly discounted price<br /></br>
          <h4>Goals for this year:</h4><br />
          1. Continue doing the good works from last few years.<br /></br>
          2. Create 10 improv workshops inside areas schools. Focusing on the Junior High Age group because Improv is most helpful for those kids.<br /></br>
          3. Create workshops for teachers to get more improv into schools on a daily basis.<br /></br>
          4. Add a research component to the Special Needs program so we can quantify our progress which will make it possible to allow other programs to use the techniques that we are refining.<br /></br>
          So donate now, whether you’re a veteran improviser who wants to give the gift to the next generation or an audience member who just wants to give back to the community.
          We (and the kids!) really appreciate it.<br /></br>
          You can specify your donation amount on PayPal’s checkout page. Thanks again!
