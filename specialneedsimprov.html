            The Hideout Theatre is committed to growing our Building Connections program by offering programming
            to a wide range of youth, including: youth with Autism, at-risk youth, homeless youth, youth with trauma
             histories/attachment challenges, and youth with mental health issues. Having adapted programming allows
             the Hideout to customize class settings and instruction to specific groups, which maximizes accessibility,
             fun, and therapeutic benefit for all involved. The Hideout Theatre celebrates neurodiversity, and solely
             uses “special needs” as a “catch-all” way to cue parents and caregivers to offerings outside of our
             traditional classes. We’re delighted you’re here with us!

            The Building Connections program at the Hideout Theatre is the best of its kind in the nation, maybe
            the world. It combines a high quality curriculum with skilled and dedicated instructors who collaborate
            with a level of professionalism that most schools and universities would envy.

          Improv classes are an excellent forum for all youth to gain confidence, build social skills, practice
          life skills, and have fun. For Building Connections youth, improv provides a wonderful opportunity for
          personal growth in a safe environment. Parents have reported that their children have gained a wide variety
          of benefits from taking classes, including expressive language gains, increased confidence, improved social
          skills, a decrease in negative behaviors, and an increase in self-expression. While improv has significant
          therapeutic applications, most importantly, these classes provide youth with an opportunity to excel, have fun,
           and express themselves.</br>

          <strong>ASD Classes:</strong></br>
          These classes will take place in a safe and fun setting where students can explore and challenge themselves.
          A very low teacher/student ratio will ensure that each student gets the attention they need. These classes will be
          tailored to youth and young adults with Asperger’s (or compatible diagnoses), and will focus on having fun, improving
          social skills, increasing self-awareness, increasing self-expression, and gaining confidence. If you/your child child
          has a diagnosis similar to Asperger’s, or a compatible developmental disorder, please contact us so that we can assess
          whether this class would be a good fit for you/your child!
