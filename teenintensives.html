        <h3>About the Intensive</h3>
        <p>
          </br>
          Take a week to work on your improv and acting skills this summer. First we’ll cover the basics of improv acting,
          so you know how to walk on the stage with nothing and create worlds. Then we will get in there and work your scenes
          to make them as full and rich as possible. Including playing with character, timing, interactions, reactions, and
          narrative structure. By the end of the week you’ll be ready to take the stage in our own performance for your friends
          and family. And blow them away!</br></br>
          Visit our main Improv Summer Camp page for information on camps for younger children.

          Each of our Teen Intensives will have a special topic, or improv format, that is used to focus the instruction.</br>
          <indent>
            <h4>Exploring Narrative (June 19-23)</h4></br>
            Instructors: Kareem Badr and Rob Yoho
            <indent>
              Narrative Improv – creating full plays from nothing – is the signature style of the Hideout Theatre. In this one week intensive
              you will learn the structure of stories, how to create and develop a protagonist, how to raise the stakes so your audience cares,
              and how to find beautifully satisfying endings. Although this intensive is focused on improv, it would be helpful for any type of
              story creator from writers to film creators.</br>
              Kareem Badr is a co-owner of the Hideout and one of the foremost teachers of narrative improv nationally and internationally.</br>
              Rob Yoho earned his MFA in directing from Baylor University – he works with both scripted and improvised plays and this cross-pollination creates a unique perspective on story creation.
            </indent>
            <h4>Games and Fun (July 17-21)</h4></br>
            Instructor: Courtney Hopkin
            <indent>
              Fast, furious and fun – improv games deliver hilarious content in quick, bite sized pieces. In this class you’ll learn how to
              playfully connect with your scene partners, how to find the game of any scene, and how to develop the scenic aspects of any game.
              You’ll find the joy in silly competitions and how to make the most of messing with your friends. This intensive is for those that
              really like to play and make other’s laugh.</br>
              Courtney Hopkin is a member of Rhino Dino – Austin’s foremost short form improv troupe. She also directed “I’ll Take the Physical
              Challenge” the Hideout’s wildly sucessful show forcing improvisors through a succession of bizar and hilarious challenges.
            </indent>
            <h4>A Study in Characters (July 31 – Aug 4)</h4>
            Instructor: Luke Wallens
            <indent>
              In this class you will really delve deeply into what it means to create a character. You’ll learn how to develop who
              your character is and what they want. How to support your fellow improvisors in their character journey and how to put
              it all together to make a final show that will blow the minds of your audience. This class would also be great for actors
              and writers – anyone who works with developing real characters.</br>
              Luke Wallens has been a member of the Hideout’s weekly children’s show for 6 years as both an actor and director. In addition
              to improv he also curates a monthly stand up show and teaches kids with special needs.
